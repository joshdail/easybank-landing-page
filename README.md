### Useful resources

- [A Modern CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/) - I used this, with a few modifications of my own, to unset the default browser styling. Resetting the CSS makes it much easier to avoid unknowns interfering with my CSS rules
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - I constantly consult this site for Flexbox, Grid, and other CSS topics.
- [CSS Filter Generator](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - I used this codepen tool to create CSS filters for the SVG hover states.
